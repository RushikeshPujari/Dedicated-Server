Remote Method Invocation (RMI) is an API which allows an object to invoke a 
method on an object that exists in another address space, which could be on the same 
machine or on a remote machine. Through RMI, object running in a JVM present on 
a computer (Client side) can invoke methods on an object present in another JVM 
(Server side). RMI creates a public remote server object that enables client and 
server side communications through simple method calls on the server object
